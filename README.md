# BattleCity

My school project was to write remake of Battle City in C++ using SFML library and SFML Game Development book. Built in Visual Studio 2022. Currently this game is playable with gradually increasing difficulty, multiplayer on one keyboard, and 5 levels. Needs to be done: endgame score screen, construction mode and sounds. Feel free to do everything you want to.
