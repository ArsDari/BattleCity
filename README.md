# BattleCity

My school project â€” Battle City remake using SFML library and SFML Game Development book. Built in Visual Studio 2022. Currently have working gameplay with gradually increasing difficulty and 5 levels, expect endgame screen and construction mode and sounds. Maybe will finish, maybe not. Feel free to do everything you want to.
